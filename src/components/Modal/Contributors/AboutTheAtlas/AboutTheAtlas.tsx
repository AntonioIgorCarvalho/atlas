        The Atlas showcases recent research revealing that understanding community movement patterns is crucial for understanding economic growth and mobility. Places with more diverse movement patterns are more likely to have higher near-future economic growth. The goal of the Atlas is to make these insights more accessible. The team utilizes data analytics to produce insights for people, business owners, and authorities and help making informed decisions.

        This website can inform a new generation of data-informed strategies and advanced methods that are used to understand how human behavior (e.g. movements, spending) shapes economic prosperity. The current map intends to provide insights for small business owners and help them make informed decisions about the location for starting their new business or subsidiary branch.
